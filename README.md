##Developing

This is a sinatra app that uses compass to manage its stylesheets. If you're going to edit styles, run `compass watch` to compile changes from public/scss into public/stylesheets.

To run a dev server, my preferred solution is `shotgun`

###Dependencies

This project uses rubygems and Bundler to manage dependencies. run `bundle install` to make sure you have everything you need before starting your local server.
