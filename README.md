what is this site? is it just a static "TONIGHT"? I want it to be something more.

questions this site could answer:

1. what kind of pizza should i make?

    random selection among crust, sauce, toppings, cheeses
2. why is tonight a good night for pizza?

    The important thing to remember here is that there is *always* a reason for tonight to be pizza night.
    - "because it's friday!"
    - "because it's the weekend!"
    - "because it's July 4th"
    - pick a random entry from today on wikipedia
    - hardcode a few dates, like 
3. who should come over to eat pizza?

    kind of useless. random select among a list of relatives

4. my local pizza night? "my friends and i have a semi-regular pizza night, can we sign up for an account and reserve portland.whenthefuckispizzanight.com?" Then they get access to a dashboard where they can specify when their pizza nights are. Pizza night attendees, pizzas, location, description, time. Link to google calendar?
